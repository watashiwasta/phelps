On December 27th, 1995, they opened the doors to 49 West in downtown Annapolis.</p><p>Little did we know, a big snowstorm came through. People didnt know who we were or that we were open, but we opened anyway and just invited anybody who noticed us, said Cahalan.</p><p>The caf is celebrating 30 years in business. Some locals consider it Annapolis' Living Room. </p><p>49 West features live music, art, and a variety of food. Their menu offers breakfast, lunch, and dinner options, including pastries and some Korean dishes.</p><p>Our locals are what helped us get through all our hard times. Theyre here daily and weekly. That includes all our musicians who play here. We have art shows, and almost seven nights a week, we have live music, said Cahalan.</p><p>On any given night, you can walk into their listening room to enjoy jazz, American roots, folk, indie, bluegrass, bossa nova, and classical music.</p><p>We have a lot of singer-songwriters and up-and-coming artists. We also have a songwriters open mic every second Thursday of the month, said Cahalan.</p><p>Its an intimate environment with dinner and a show. Some of the dishes at 49 West are inspired by Cahalans childhood, including Bulgogi, Bibimbap, and Sarahs All Day Bowl.</p><p>This is something I grew up eating when my parents werent home. My mom always had rice in the rice cooker, and wed fry up some eggs. It was just a nice meal to get us through between coming home from school and dinner time, said Cahalan.</p><p>49 West is one of 37 restaurants participating in <a href="https://www.wmar2news.com/localeats/a-good-deal-and-even-better-meal-whats-on-the-menu-for-annapolis-restaurant-week">Annapolis Restaurant Week</a>.

Braised short rib over mashed potatoes. Duck fat fried donuts with red wine maple syrup. Blackened rock fish tacos with avocado and aioli. The micro greens are micro cilantro, so you'll get that big burst of cilantro in there as well."</p><p>Thats just some of the dishes youll find on the restaurant week menu at Atlantic Food &amp; Spirits in Catonsville.</p><p>"As soon as we were posted on the site, people started calling. Hey, what's going on? I heard about your restaurant, but I haven't been there. So it was really good to see over the weekend and on Monday, new faces coming in, said Bobby Bassett, Chef and Partner with Atlantic Food &amp; Spirits.</p><p>We have this large community that comes together, and we start to see some of the same faces and we see the different families. We've only been open three years, but in three years, I've got to see kids that come work for us grow up, said Basset.</p><p>Basset adds that Baltimore County Restaurant Week helps to keep business flowing during Dry January and the post-holiday rush. Its also a great boost for the locally-owned business that opened in 2022.</p><p>I grew up in Lansdowne, right around the corner. I went to school at Western Tech, which is three miles from this restaurant, and that's where I did my culinary program. So for me, when I had the opportunity to come here and own a restaurant in Catonsville, I was like, wow, this is kind of full circle, bringing me back home, said Basset.</p><p>You can get a four course dinner for $45 and a three course lunch for $25. After you dine, comes the wine. The restaurant is connected to their wine and spirits store that's open 7 days a week. And yes, that includes Sunday! </p><p>The countys winter restaurant week runs through Sunday. Over 45 restaurants are participating.</p><p>For a full list of participating eateries, check out the <a href="https://baltimorecountyrestaurantweek.com/">website</a>.</p>    </html>]]></content:encoded>
